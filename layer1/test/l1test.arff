"FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES","France s right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its inflation estimate a half percentage point to per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and per cent from a per cent target written into the annual budget last september Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation budget cutting rigour and pay restraint But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year perhaps in the autumn to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year The big question is whether the government s policy of wage moderation will be maintained he added The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout per cent this year with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation Edmond Maire meeting with Chirac today renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices Calling the government s policies unbalanced and unjust he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist led CGT the largest of France s unions declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority But with unemployment nearing per cent last month and still rising government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that commented Michel Develle economist at recently privatised Banque Paribas Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year partly blamed by the government for higher inflation had undermined the unions power and popularity he said Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast perhaps to or per cent this year against last years per cent But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed he commented Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a per cent surge in January living costs But they claimed it was a once off phenomenon that should have no knock on impact on the rest of the year Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that so long as the government kept wages under control Prices could rise per cent in the first three months of and two per cent in the first half year fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute INSEE Marais said But the second half year should be better he added Ironically one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit several analysts said So long as public sector wages are held down higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth they said Reuter"

"ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U S PRIME RATE","Quarter point prime rate increases to pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve s policy intentions economists said Based on the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate it probably makes sense for others to follow but no rush is likely said Paul McCulley of E F Hutton and Co Citibank s surprise base rate increase quickly followed by Chase sent U S bond prices lower and the dollar higher McCulley said that once the spread between three month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase It has been under points recently However banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term analysts said They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements rather than lead them For example the last prime rate increase occurred in June when banks lifted the rate to pct from pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year Major banks had been posting a pct prime rate since last August when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed s half point discount rate cut to the current pct level on August The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates There should be a split prime for a while with some posting a pct rate and others pct said David Jones of Aubrey G Lanston and Co Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today s meeting voted no change in Fed policy But he said the Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon Jones said that while the FOMC probably voted no policy change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today s coupon pass said Joseph Liro of S G Warburg and Co In a move that came a day earlier than most expected the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account This seasonal reserve add is called a pass The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change said Elizabeth Reiners economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc She said the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate is now around basis points compared with a basis point average in Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase The Dean Witter economist said that today s prime rate rise may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line Reiners said that given recent problems with loans to developing countries large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move In raising their prime rates banks cited a higher cost of funds In the three business days through Monday the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct But quarter end pressures helped push up funds The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year Funds traded between five and pct Once the special distortions end analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the pct area They said that if it stabilizes near there banks may not quickly boost their prime rates But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar Then banks would lift prime rates quickly Reuter"

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND","If we go on using up farmland as we have done since there will be none left in years to grow grain on Xu Jinfeng a middle aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes China has to feed one quarter of the world s population but only one seventh of its land is arable Sharp increases in farm output since turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in and again in But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in and a slightly smaller amount last year It gained mln new mouths to feed during the two years We lost very little land prior to when the industrialisation began official Xu said Since then nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up Last year we lost land to a new railway line Xu said But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses she added The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year The present situation of abusing occupying unlawfully wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious said an article in the official press explaining the new measures It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland it said China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only hectares of arable land to other uses while anything more than that must be approved by the city government The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China s people get enough grain to eat The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low making it more profitable for them to grow other crops To offset this the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China s mln city residents Rural factories also subsidise grain output paying farmers bonuses to grow it Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices Chen Zuyuan Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang said the government listened too much to the demands of selfish city people and could raise city grain prices without any problem But the government has ruled out a price rise Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability said a China Daily editorial this month The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term We must be very careful We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises he said The problem is how to do it The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents In addition the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes Under reforms introduced in the late s farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land As the expiration date of the year contract is almost at the halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about the future the China Daily said in an editorial last month Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it For most of the period of Communist rule the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long term investment the newspaper said REUTER"

"TREASURY S MULFORD BACKS DEBT CONVERSIONS","Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily indebted countries over quick fix political plans to help ease their debt burden In my view debt conversions or swaps into either equity or local debt claims provide a preferable route to debt relief for the debtor nations particularly if combined with measures to encourage new equity investment and the repatriation of flight capital he told the House Subcommittee on International Development Institutions Mulford criticized what he called large scale solutions to the debt problems effecting many developing countries ranging from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions for lending While such approaches may have some political appeal they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive he said He said debt conversions or swaps are more effective because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can help indebted countries overcome their own problems Reuter"

"BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS","The Bank of England proposed that banks in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets In addition the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified the Bank said The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year In about billion dlrs of new eurobonds were offered according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine Up until now there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues However eurobond market participants believe the Bank of England is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms But the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle Banking sources said that while the Bank of England is reluctant to inhibit competition it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently The Bank s assessment of the appropriateness of a bank s lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market concerned the Bank s proposal said Once a firm has received permission to act as lead underwriter the exposure will be valued at one sixth of the face amount of the securities Nominal exposure exceeding pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it must be notified in advance for exposure of over pct of capital The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of days following a binding commitment to underwrite After that any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities revolving credits or commercial paper the Bank said The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen its supervisory powers over banks in the paper which called for comments from professionals by March to allow their possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned final discussion in Parliament scheduled before summer The new Banking Bill updating the Banking Act is the third leg of the Conservative government s legislation for the supervision of financial institutions It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act aimed to bolster investor protection and the Building Societies Act which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between recognised banks and licensed deposit takers and tighten legal controls making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in advance of planned exposures in excess of pct of their capital and to have the Bank supervise exposures between and pct of capital were not under debate the paper showed However preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed it said Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a case by case basis rather than along general lines Amendments involved the Bank s proposed treatment of exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other units of their own group of companies the paper showed They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed the paper showed Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their own group of companies would usually be looked into on a case by case basis under new proposals it said The paper said exposures to state owned industries and other public sector authorities in the U K and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees It cautioned that exposures to U K local authorities and those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department would probably not qualify for such treatment On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of another bank an earlier proposed pct of capital ceiling could be exceeded in individual cases But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking to take over the exposure if problems were to occur and state in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary s balance sheet to meet precise group objectives the paper said On collateral security it said this should normally only be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a bank s exposure up to pct of its capital base The presence of security taken on its own will be considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure in excess of pct but only in the most exceptional circumstances and even then to a very limited extent it said

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT POLISH SANCTIONS","Poland says U S Sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses Some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving They did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said The U S Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation MFN trading status from Poland in in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy an offshoot of the central planning commission According to one Western envoy an expert on Polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the United States as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U S In the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed Imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U S Markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert It s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy There s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality Describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry MFN doesn t really mean anything only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries It will be difficult to regain access to the U S Market because different forces are in play now said one Western envoy He said Polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U S Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland s efforts to regain entry Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the U S Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally But a Western economist said The argument that U S Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won t cut any ice The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity Nevertheless Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund IMF and World Bank made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners He stressed that the U S had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland s partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt Putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate REUTER"

"BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS","Brazil s recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in The developing world s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation Aldo Roldan Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil where pure commodities account for some pct of exports and in had a total value of around billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share At the end of the talks he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales the dealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled cents lower Thursday at cents a lb while more distant deliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped up Brazilian marketing efforts They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential Bache Securities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can t afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our U S exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American Soybean Association ASA said this year s Brazilian soybean harvest could total mln tonnes versus mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U S crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U S government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan We re getting into a period when they Brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said But he added it will be a while before U S exports fall to below mln bushels a week from around mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias said it would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazil s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said Brazil s other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so I don t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market would collapse and they can t afford to do that she added Reuter"

"U S FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX","The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller who joined the board last August He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates Moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation His idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly Discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says Heller In the past this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa The so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early s is still considered unworkable in the present world But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also For one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy Moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems Treasury Secretary James Baker the Reagan administration s chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes Seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters He appears convinced that officials from West Germany France Britain Japan Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing The Heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates As envisioned by Heller a basket of say major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis In times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis Moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says In addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says However he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the s because of action by the OPEC cartel would have to be discounted in such a system He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities Reuter"

"U S URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN","The U S is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy a Reagan administration official said The official s comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms In addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank where Third World debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it At the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground The Philippine proposal together with Argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with Reuters All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named In October Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations In return America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth The multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor Brazil was clearly an exception The official who played a key role in developing the U S Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said Among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create a megabank which could swap Third World debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional American or European institutions Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs He emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested Other U S Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt This plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine I don t think they ever will He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution Meanwhile the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above Libor The Philippine proposal is very interesting it s quite unique and I don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes These tradeable dollar denominated notes would have a six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee a payment of point over Libor Until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low The talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt The country which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year owes an overall billion dlrs of debt But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation a development until now unacceptable to the banks It s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek Some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added He said the U S Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines Reuter"

markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said We need inflation for U S producers to compete with foreign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped pct in February s PPI With many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U S competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in U S debt Brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose pct from first quarter to first quarter reflecting to a large degree a pct drop in the trade weighted real value of the dollar from February to February Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose pct at an annual rate in the second half of which has contributed to rising U S industrial output It s the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of pct in the first quarter It s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production Utilities output rose pct in February after gaining pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to million units at an annual rate from million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U S business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of January business inventories rose pct the largest gain since July when inventories rose pct the Commerce Department said Business sales dropped pct in January the largest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react to month to month changes The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months Ramirez said They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months Reuter"
"U S FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT","A secondary market for resale of farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be set up this year Congressional and financial sources said Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate Furthermore Representatives of the Farm Credit System commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market Frank Naylor chairman of the Farm Credit Administration FCA which regulates the farm credit system yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture as long as the farm credit system is a key player Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac industry sources said Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi government farm credit system traditionally the largest lender to farmers A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high quality loans on farmland to poolers who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage backed securities for resale to investors called Aggie mae by some proponents The FCA and financially troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea mainly because any farm secondary market established in the private sector which excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to the system which has lost billion dlrs in two years Naylor and farm credit system officials have said However the system and FCA have become more positive to the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were appointed the agent for a secondary market If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools of farm mortgage loans it would benefit from the fees charged for providing this service the Life Insurers study said Congressional sources believe a secondary market available to both private lenders and the farm credit system with the system as agent could be included in a major federal government rescue package for the system to be drafted by Congress later this year A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea the American Council of Life Insurers concludes that the farm credit system s market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established The study was released earlier today The study said a secondary market could be established with virtually no federal money if the government provided a guarantee of pct of the farm loans but a private co insurance plan guaranteed the first pct of any losses It estimated between mln and two billion dlrs of the eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would fall to basis points due to the new resale market The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why leading U S farm organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea Proponents say a secondary market also would increase liquidity in farm lending and spread the risk of such loans Reuter"

"EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED","European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year despite recent firmness in world prices analysts and industry sources said A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while so far European Community EC growers plan unchanged to lower areas increases are expected in some Eastern European nations Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F O Licht Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this In recent years good autumn weather has given yields a late boost making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so called C sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC A and B quotas which receive full and partial price support respectively Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices However with the EC budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic A and B quotas they added In France the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year s hectares nine pct below the previous year The basic trend is towards stability a FIRS spokesman said Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels he said Beet sugar output last year was mln tonnes with an average yield of tonnes per ha the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below the previous year and a five year average In West Germany recent price rises have not altered plans since planting decisions were taken a few months ago industry sources said The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in when yields were above average Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced hectares against last year British Sugar Plc the monopoly beet processor has signed up U K Farmers to grow mln tonnes of beet This should yield about mln tonnes of whites Last year s crop equalled the second highest ever at mln tonnes British Sugar has A and B quotas totalling mln tonnes of whites and its C output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease resistant seed types Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans Wincenty Nowicki a deputy director of Cukropol the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises said World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level The national plan set before prices began to rise put plantings this year at hectares against in Nowicki said Last year production was mln tonnes World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market an official at the national beet growers association said Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year s ha especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya Beet output last season of mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected mln tonnes of white sugar Dutch plantings are expected to fall to ha from a record in as a new self imposed quota system comes into force a spokesman for Centrale Suiker the second largest Dutch sugar processor said The new system aims for an average of around tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of C sugar Last year the Netherlands produced a record mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined A and B quota of only tonnes The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of C sugar really worthwhile the spokesman said Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged Licht put this year s Soviet beet area at mln ha against mln last year Hungary is expanding its beet area to ha from some in the official MTI news agency said but

"SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS","The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the deadline for the ending of restrictions a central bank spokesman said The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations in line with deregulation in the banking industry he said in a telephone interview The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain s financial sector a move triggered by entry into the Community last year Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation a process that began in when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches Since then foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about pct of the system s lending assets Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of mln pesetas The mln peseta limit was set last March Between that date and the end of last year some mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans The central bank spokesman said operations over billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in days Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding formerly obtainable through deposits by issuing certificates of deposit bonds and commercial paper They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues while before they had to be converted into deposits Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans which previously were limited to three times a bank s capital equity The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates The reserve requirement which was already in place on normal peseta deposits was intended to curb short term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government s money supply growth target A foreign banker said high reserve requirements which now account for about pct of deposits placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to pct from pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation The real problem is the freeing of interest rates the banker said This is going to take a big bite out of profits The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to days The chairman of one of Spain s leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a pct drop in profits this year REUTER"

forecast in the Autumn Statement inflation may continue to edge up for a time perhaps exceeding pct by the summer before falling back to pct by the end of the year he added Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal was billion stg or pct of GDP The planned PSBR for was set at billion stg On monetary policy Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M measure would be two to six pct in fiscal No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M aggregate he said But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as of course will the exchange rate the Chancellor told Parliament Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non oil tax revenues in general and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular On oil prices Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average dlrs per barrel in calendar He said it is clear that the increased flow of non oil tax revenues coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure puts the public finances in a very strong position Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at pct of GDP in future We have reached what I judge to be the Medium Term Financial Strategy s appropriate destination a PSBR of pct of GDP My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead Lawson said Inevitably this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation which of course remains a major objective of government policy But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution and to build a still firmer base for the future Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book On corporation tax he said the rate will remain unchanged at pct in But companies capital gains will be charged at the appropriate corporation tax rate He said that under the new proposed system companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax ACT payments against tax on capital gains Taken together these changes should yield mln stg in Lawson said Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax to be known as Pay and File This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection and would not come into force until the early s Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT As from today companies may elect to have up to pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their PRT liabilities in existing fields until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred Second there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U K Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field On business employment Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers Lawson said that in future traders registered for Value Added Tax VAT would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to days he added and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to stg New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance he added The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at stg Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment The change will take effect on April but genuine trading companies will not be affected He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans also from April In future banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan he said The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence to pct from pct Lawson reiterated the government s aim of reducing basic taxation to pence in the pound but added given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR that goal cannot be achieved in this budget Small companies corporation tax is also being reduced to pct he said On the Lloyd s insurance market Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd s syndicates bringing it into line with that

"SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT","Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production official and trade sources said Although prices have risen to around eight from five U S Cents per lb in the past six months they are still below the region s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert Manuel Rico a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries GEPLACEA told Reuters However Rico said it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable he said Officials in Mexico Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go The prices are ridiculous said Julian Mateo vice president of Costa Rica s Sugar Cane Industrial Agricultural League At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output given the instability of world markets An official at Colombia s National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets The market is very unstable What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything In the latest year for which full figures are available Central and South American nations produced mln tonnes raw value of sugar of which mln were exported A year earlier they had produced and exported about more according to the London based International Sugar Organization Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover Miguel Guerrero director of the Dominican Republic s National Sugar Institute said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply Output had slumped to under tonnes a year from in the late s Obsolete refineries poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output he added Plans of nearby Cuba the world s largest cane sugar exporter to increase output to mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious trade sources said Output is running well below the record mln produced in Cuba suffers from run down plantations harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals Last year bad weather added to its troubles and output fell to mln tonnes from mln in The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U S And in the case of some Caribbean countries European Community EC import quotas for which they receive prices well above free market levels Progressive reductions in the U S Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market Peru for example shipped tonnes to the U S In both and This fell to in and this year its quota is only A national cooperative official said that as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru s production cost the future of the industry is uncertain At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which according to the group s executive secretary Eduardo Latorre grows like a weed throughout the region Brazil the largest cane producer with output of around mln tonnes uses over half to produce alcohol fuel Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency The difference in the price the state run Sugar and Alcohol Institute IAA pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some mln dlrs a year Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year coupled with a drought reduced cane crop has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in trade sources said Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles However the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region s sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U S And EC change their policies The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries Brazil s Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region s industry out of steady decline Such an agreement would have to have both U S And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact They have to realise that the more our economies suffer the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region s billion dollar foreign debt GEPLACEA s Latorre said Reuter"

"DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U S OIL INDUSTRY","The U S Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices and the subsequent growth in oil imports industry analysts said The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better said Daniel Yergin director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates which recently completed a survey of the U S Congress on energy issues Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee Today U S Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed Herrington said I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day addition to U S production U S oil output was off to mln bpd in the week of March down six pct from last year the American Petroleum Institute said Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term Paul Mlotok oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we ve only altered our average price scenerio to about dlrs for the year Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U S crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over dlrs to renew exploration John Lichtblau president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said The continuing decline in U S oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U S government policy Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time Lowering the producing industry s tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant to output than a price increase but would not raise energy costs Lichtblau said But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U S are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee Ronald Tappmeyer president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors said The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation The association represents some drilling and oil service companies The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman Orval Hansen showed support for the oil import fee from pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry At the same time pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests But pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise Yergin said that imports above pct of U S requirements is a critical symbolic level If they imports move above that level a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action But Lichtblau in a telephone interview said a pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before In U S oil imports rose to pct of u s energy requirements and shopuld be about pct in he added Reuter"

"U S GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT","A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U S agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U S prices to be at world market levels U S grain trade industry officials said They said that Shultz s comments while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action In response to a query on what the State Department s position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U S is going to trade The Soviet Union the world s largest grain importer has bought no U S wheat for more than a year complaining the price was far above world market levels A U S offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower priced wheat through the export enhancement program EEP was also rebuffed due to the price Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U S wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union grain industry sources said Intense speculation the U S might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another cents by midday at dlrs per bushel while CBT March wheat was up cents at dlrs I m not sure this is an about face but it s clearly a recognition that unless we re competitive we won t sell to the Soviet Union said a lobbyst for a major commodity group We have to be competitive It s ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else Shultz told the farm leaders That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets he said If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U S selling wheat to the USSR under EEP it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow an industry lobbyst said National Wheat Grower s officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary s comments His comments were not discouraging but they didn t in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP an official with the wheat group said The Wheat Growers official noted however that there is significance in that fact that we haven t seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets In a meeting with exporters this week Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow the officials said An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets said that the Shultz comments are consistent with what he Shultz has taught for years as an economist but said they don t necessarily relate to the Soviet Union Amstutz could not be reached for comment and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz s statements But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow If he didn t say no then there s a chance This is potentially a positive development a commodity source said Reuter"

"MEXICO TO SIGN LOAN AMID CALLS FOR CHANGE","Mexico s billion dlr loan package will be signed in New York tomorrow amid increasing calls from both creditors and debtors for a streamlining of the tortuous process of raising such jumbo loans bankers said Pressure for change has mounted because the Mexican deal has been even more difficult to syndicate than bankers feared Several tentative signing dates had to be scrapped and even now five months after the loan was agreed with a bank advisory committee on October dozens of Mexico s some creditor banks worldwide are still refusing to participate The resistance to the deal must be seen alongside the fact that it is the largest loan for a Latin American debtor since the region s debt crisis flared up in Mexico will also sign agreements to reschedule billion dlrs of debt Moreover as the first major package built on U S Treasury Secretary James Baker s strategy of offering loans to countries willing to implement market oriented pro growth policies intense market scrutiny was only to be expected Still the split within the banks ranks came as a shock This is not an unsuccessful operation but we ve had more bickering than ever one senior banker commented Officers at small banks that have sold swapped or or written down their Mexican loans say they see no reason why they should throw good money after bad Major lenders counter that small banks must share the responsibility of making new loans and cannot expect to keep receiving interest on old debt unless they join in new ones Assistant U S Treasury Secretary David Mulford said recently the reluctance of small banks at one point endangered the entire Mexican package Things have improved but money center bankers are determined to keep hounding recalcitrant banks even once the billion dlr target has been reached The loan presently is about pct committed People who are outside shouldn t think they ve been saved once we get over billion dlrs one warned But rounding up free rider banks entails such a huge drain on management resources that more and more bankers are acknowledging that the syndicates may have to shrink One idea is to levy new loan contributions on the basis of current exposure instead of outstandings at an earlier base date August in the case of Mexico Another streamlining idea is to allow small banks to escape by swapping their loans for exit bonds that a debtor would issue at a discount Argentina has pressed for this solution so far to no avail arguing that the smallest of its bank creditors account for just one pct of its foreign bank debt and that the next banks account only for a further six pct Central bank president Jose Luis Machinea said Argentina may not receive the billion dlrs in bank loans it is seeking until September which would be a year after negotiations began with the International Monetary Fund The protracted negotiations have damaged the confidence of investors in Argentina forcing up interest rates and spurring capital flight he said We have to introduce some common sense into the discussion Machinea said this week in Cambridge Mass He was echoed by Mexico s deputy planning minister Pedro Aspe Armella who said the delay in signing his country s loan has made it difficult to map economic policy with any certainty It s a sad affair he told the Cambridge meeting Bankers said Mexico became so frustrated with the delay in the loan that it suspended its debt equity swap program last month to put pressure on the banks Other strains have intensified between U S and non U S banks partly because U S regulations and accounting rules discourage writedowns Critics say this prompts U S banks to focus too much on ensuring steady interest payments from debtors in the short term possibly to the detriment of longer term solutions Because more than half of the banks baulking at the Mexican deal are American some foreign bankers think other U S banks should make up the difference This issue of national share was defused on the Mexican committee but bankers say it will probably recur in talks with Argentina and Brazil whose finance minister Dilson Funaro has already suggested separate negotiations with regional committees of creditors Streamlining of the new money process is running parallel with efforts to develop a broader menu of alternatives to new loans such as trade credits or debt equity conversions We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may in effect be essential to future bank syndications Mulford said last week He told the banks to stop complaining that there is no leeway in current procedures and to come up with ideas Some steps have already been taken interest payments for Chile have been stretched out and banks are debating whether to accept partial interest payments from the Philippines in paper instead of cash Because the banks want to isolate hard line Brazil by clinching a deal with Argentina as soon as practicable bankers said the Argentine package is likely to be along the established lines of the Baker Plan But some bankers are speculating that the Brazilian deal when it comes will be radically different As such the loan for Mexico could go down in the history books as the biggest but also the last jumbo I m convinced it ll be the last one in this form one banker said Reuter"

"BRAZIL SEEN AS VANGUARD FOR CHANGING DEBT STRATEGY","Brazil s hard line debt stance though meeting creditor resistance is boosting political initiatives in Latin America aimed at broadening the global strategy regional debt officials and economic analysts say Now more than ever it is clear that Latin America cannot pay under present conditions without sacrificing growth Peruvian President Alan Garcia said referring to Brazil And as debtors and creditors prepare for their annual meeting at the Inter American Development Bank in Miami next week the region s debt crisis is clearly coming to a head Around billion dlrs in commercial bank debt have been rescheduled since with interest rate margins now below one pct multi year accords a norm and no financial crash in sight but a lasting solution seems no nearer Virtually all Latin American leaders backed Brazil s suspension of interest payments on billion dlrs of private bank debt last month though prospects of a chain default are still remote Mexico Colombia Argentina and others rejected such action and Mexican finance minister Gustavo Petricioli merely said Brazil is having problems we are sure will be temporary But Brazil s action has had an impact on other debt negotiations speeding agreement for Chile and Venezuela last month and influencing current talks with Argentina Pressure for new solutions has built up on several fronts with the Philippines joining Brazil in seeking interest relief and Ecuador announcing force majeure on debt payments following a serious earthquake Private banks are being increasingly urged to renew lending and accept innovative repayment schemes not only by debtors but also by official agencies which have stepped up their own credit flows as part of the U S inspired plan One Latin American debt official said he saw the Brazil and Ecuadorean announcements as spurring moves by other debtors to link debt service payments to macroeconomic indicators such as export earnings GDP or raw materials prices Despite this debtor countries continue to accept the case by case approach and Cuba s call for a joint negotiating front is not being promoted by Brazil or even defended by Peru the region s flag bearer in unilateral payment decisions Each nation must negotiate its debt independently according to its own needs Brazilian foreign minister Ramiro de Abreu Sodre said in Caracas at the weekend Venezuela s rapid agreement with its creditors soon after Brazil s move had been seen by the political opposition as a betrayal of debtor solidarity but de Abreu praised the Venezuelan negotiators for achieving a favourable deal Argentina Bolivia Costa Rica and others are also pursuing normal negotiations with creditor banks while at the same time pressing hard for better terms particularly lower interest rate spreads Latin American officials say that while the debt should be negotiated case by case their governments are promoting a general framework for talks based on growth and development priorities lower interest payments and new financing The Brazilian and Ecuadorean experience shows orthodox solutions to debt cases don t work said a senior Peruvian government official responsible for debt affairs He saw a growing likelihood that other countries would follow Peru s action in setting a pct debt payment limit in the face of trade and other factors beyond debtors control such as minimal bank lending These factors have contributed to a billion dlr net outflow from Latin America in the last five years and Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro says Brazil alone paid back billion dlrs in this time and received just billion in loans Latin American debtors feel they have complied with their side of the bargain slashing public spending devaluing currencies cutting inflation privatizing state enterprises and introducing debt equity schemes Brazil as the region s biggest debtor and its most diversified economy has now apparently adopted the principle that a tough position with its creditors will avoid a more serious crisis later on We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis Funaro told a conference in Rio de Janeiro this week billion dlr debt burden this year are slim with coffee prices plunging oil prices up but still well below levels and interest rates beginning to rise Mexico expects one to two pct growth instead of the two to three pct projected earlier and inflation near pct after pct last year Brazilian officials expect growth of only two pct after eight pct last year and a pct drop in the projected trade surplus while independent estimates put inflation at pct Political and economic analysts in Brazil believe the payment suspension will give new impetus to tackling the regional crisis though they expect protracted negotiations a view echoed by senior international bank officials Some banks including Citibank Morgan Guaranty and Bank of America are already preparing to downgrade their Brazil loans Brazil s refusal to accept an IMF program a condition set by many banks for new lending meanwhile reflects the view of most Latin American governments that equate the Fund with recession But Brazil and Venezuela are the only countries in the region to have rescheduled debt without an IMF program REUTER"

"U S ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH","The U S economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say Some of the slowness experienced in the October December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U S economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by billion dlrs a six pct rise to billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose a healthy pct the agency said The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct The January February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said Lyle Gramley an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association The U S jobless rate in February and January was pct the lowest rate since March The number of new non farm jobs rose by in February after a gain in January and a December increase the government said The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to pct in the first quarter said Gramley Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter Gramley said He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi family housing units Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant pct rate in the first quarter of accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk pct annual rate in the third quarter The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U S trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar s value over the last year and half The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levy predicted Most of it will be through import reduction but at least one third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U S goods become more attractive overseas The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the U S economy will grow by a respectable pct for the year compared with a pct rate last year As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the U S has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U S and others U S officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries The U S economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt The government last week said the U S economy grew at a modest pct annual rate during the fourth quarter There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the U S trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of While fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped a healthy pct during the period the government said It also reported that inflation as measured by the GNP price deflator remained in check growing a moderate pct in the period the lowest rise in years The government also reported that consumer spending a key element of the five year economic recovery jumped pct in February after falling two pct in January The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements of the U S economy was showing signs of recovery In its latest report on current economic conditions the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U S manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar s value He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years Reuter"

"NEW S AFRICA ACCORD WITH BANKS BROUGHT COMPROMISE","A new agreement covering the repayment of part of South Africa s foreign debt represents a compromise between that country and its commercial bank creditors following several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations senior banking sources said In Pretoria Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termed the agreement a good deal for both South Africa and the banks But as one senior banker noted It is probably the best we could hope for We the banks wanted more money and they the South Africans didn t want to pay The new agreement will extend for three years the standstill arrangement that has been in place since August and which was due to expire on June Depending on the maturity of the various debts banks will receive on July repayments representing three pct of the arrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill It also will require the repayment over the life of the standstill of another pct of the overdue debt spread over six month invervals and depending on the maturity of the various debts for a total of slightly more than billion dlrs Last year South Africa repaid about mln dlrs out of the billion dlrs covered by the standstill At the time bankers had argued unsuccessfully for a larger repayment given the country s trade surplus of billion dlrs Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even larger repayment of around one billion dlrs Although there had been speculation that the standstill would be extended for three years many did not believe that a long term pact would be acceptable to U S banks Those banks have taken a hard line in the negotiations because of America s strong anti apartheid policies The agreement reached today differs very little from the one reached a little over a year ago However it does include one moderation of an option contained in that pact which introduces yet another catchphrase into the jargon for reschedulings The new agreement contains an exit vehicle under which banks can convert their debt into year loans Under the previous agreement banks were only given options for three year loans While the option may be unpalatable to the U S banks it could offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than half their investment over the next seven years To convert the debts a bank would have to find a borrower looking for a loan with a year maturity and then negotiate individually the interest rates to be charged The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan would be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a repayment stream that could give the bank as much as pct of face value by year seven one banker said Bankers suggested that depending on a banks political and economic forecasts for South Africa if it decided to take the option it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers They noted that South Africa s Public Investment Commission is an active borrower in this area of the market Today s agreement was reached between South Africa s chief debt negotiator Chris Stals who chairs its Standstill Coordinating Commmittee and representatives of the banks on the commercial bank technical committee The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the country s other bank creditors and that documentation covering the proposal will be mailed out shortly Because of the banks sensitivity to South Africa s apartheid regime the previous negotiations were conducted with Fritz Leutwiler the former head of the Swiss National Bank acting as mediator Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not involved himself in the negotiations since last year the bankers said Last time the banks sent their responses on the proposal to Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans This time the procedure will be less structured and will be up to the individual banks as to how they wish to handle it Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the South Africans and the banks the completion of the agreement on the repayments took many in the financial community by surprise A review of South Africa s economy by the technical committee s economic sub committee was to be held in February while the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some time this month or next month However the bankers said that because of all the publicity which surrounds South African debt negotiations the meetings were kept secret Reuter"

"CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS","One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits money dealers said As a result call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily billion marks in interest free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first days of the month Though this was above the March requirement of billion actual holdings at the weekend were billion To meet the daily average dealers said banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to billion today and tomorrow But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank s offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday This provides a rate of pct for three day deposits and is an effective floor to the market Though some liquidity from bills bought on Thursday flowed back into the market today the bulk would not return until tomorrow the start of the new month dealers said Dealers said the large banks which they did not name commanded short term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills draining liquidity for three days When other banks sought funds rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return One senior dealer said the Bundesbank with advanced knowledge of the market s needs should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day he said Bundesbank dealers could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we re not selling them in this amount he said If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses Tomorrow it will be different Call money will fall back to pct or so But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates given the delicate state of currency markets International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies including the mark Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone contributing to downward pressure on the dollar The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular the senior dealer said Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between pct or four pct This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany s major employers and the unions the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday they said Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business REUTER"
