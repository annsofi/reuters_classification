"ENERGY U S PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY","Cheap oil feedstocks the weakened U S dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching pct will propel the streamlined U S petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least major company executives predicted This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp GAF privately held Cain Chemical Inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc ASH the Kentucky based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money making petrochemical businesses to buy I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said Paul Oreffice chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co DOW adding There s no major plant capacity being added around the world now The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones Analysts say the chemical industry s biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year U S petrochemical plants are currently operating at about pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by to pct this year said John Dosher managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as pct he said Oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston said Dow would easily top the mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history In when oil prices were still above dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U S dollar Dow had profits of mln dlrs I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it Oreffice said GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U S chemical industry would report a pct gain in profits during Last year the domestic industry earned a total of billion dlrs a pct leap from The turn in the fortunes of the once sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said Pace s John Dosher Dosher said last year s fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies That helped boost U S chemical exports Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early s Finally virtually all major U S chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts GAF which made an unsuccessful attempt in to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals Another industry powerhouse W R Grace GRA has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom designed for a small group of buyers Companies like DuPont DD and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated Dosher said But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market Some top chemical executives share the concern The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes GAF s Heyman cautioned The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill advised Specialty businesses do not stay special long Houston based Cain Chemical created this month by the Sterling investment banking group believes it can generate mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend Chairman Gordon Cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont s Conoco Inc s chemical business has spent billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high margin business Cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually Garo Armen an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds said chemical makers have also

"BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION","Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies In a lecture at the University of Surrey pre released here Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to marks from above two marks at the start of Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow To reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off In other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity Koehler said The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U S Current account deficit But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U S Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports But the volume effect of falling imports to the U S And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term Koehler said A reduction in the U S Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand In Japan and West Germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than GNP In Germany this did indeed happen in Koehler said If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the U S Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U S But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U S When selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem A strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions Koehler said Given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies Koehler said REUTER"

"U S SAID TO VIEW G MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS","The United States which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied Tokyo s latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies Monetary sources said they believed that U S Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo s package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy But yesterday s statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen s rise from around to the dollar the level at the February Paris Accord to about today And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so The yen sank below at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan Kiichi Miyazawa Japan s Finance Minister said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks I would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris Miyazawa said yesterday The supplementary budget worth about billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa s departure for Washington to attend yesterday s meetings of leading industrial nations In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality The Group of Seven the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of billion to billion dlrs to halt the dollar s fall While relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium term policies has replaced the bickering over short term differences in past meetings West Germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement appears from the face of yesterday s statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable Bonn s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan s trade surpluses and America s trade deficit have already taken place No mention was made however of the U S commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U S trade shortfall that reached nearly billion dlrs last year A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates Monetary sources said that privately West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U S unit Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo s export drive to the United States the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets The ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said good progress was made Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations The United States and France backed by the International Monetary Fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried monetary sources say because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets

"U S BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON","Major U S banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said In what was the first prime rate boost since mid most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to pct citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money That spread has narrowed again A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc Brusca said a quarter point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point He said that spread had averaged around percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said David Jones of Aubrey G Lanston and Co We ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now said Harold Nathan economist at Wells Fargo Bank However he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar He said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high a prime rate rise could occur at any time Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle U S inflation As the dollar fell to a year low against the yen Friday currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar In addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the U S currency would be for the Fed to push U S interest rates higher relative to overseas rates Based particularly on the Fed s reserve management actions on Friday and today Nathan of Wells Fargo said it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed Bank funding costs and other short and long term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected On Friday the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at pct With funds trading even higher at pct today the Fed arranged only a slightly larger billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements The Fed s actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said Jones of Lanston The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar Jones said He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have a major impact on the dollar the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from pct Jones said a U S discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar Given likely Fed policy firming he said both the yield on year Treasury bonds about pct now and the prime rate may be at pct at end June and nine pct by year s end The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said Leslie of Discount Corp He said tax date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy Reuter"

"TIN TRADERS RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET","European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar based tin futures market due to be launched in October Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current free market system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange LME tin trading ceased in October Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries There is also a view among European traders that while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade would make participants uncomfortable Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam Over the past months the price moved to a ten year low of stg in March and rebounded to as high as stg in December This compares with stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October and a record high tin price of stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year LME warehouse stocks are now near a two year low at tonnes having fallen steadily from a record high of tonnes reached in February Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply demand deficit of some tonnes Analysts were predicting prices of up to stg per tonne during However the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to stg last month after approaching stg in December The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year Traders say the ITC creditor banks original tin holdings of nearly tonnes have now been almost halved and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal Some tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council s ITC buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the members nations of the International Tin Agreement The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC related holdings and halved its overall tin position Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter The Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella but to date Brazil and China two major producers remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres dealers said Reuter"

"NO REASON TO CUT RATES BUNDESBANK S SCHLESINGER","Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed The economy is picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview Concerned by the first quarter downturn the U S Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in Year on year growth was thus about two pct He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year on year pace of to eight pct well above the Bundesbank s three to six pct target He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long term capital flows Heavy inflows particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation boosted domestic money supply There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed Schlesinger said A major reason for the inflows was the market s conviction that the mark was headed higher As we can see from the market expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished Schlesinger said The recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise as the U S Did in March when the dollar rose above marks he said this would depend on the circumstances At midday here the dollar stood at marks Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react Schelsinger said One has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding It is not only our own case it is also the American case He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now But it wouldn t be good to have short term fluctuations he said Let us wait and see It is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock than the level of rates as such Schlesinger said The sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to pct he said Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation The above target growth of money supply over the past months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves a matter which might be taken up at the mid year meeting of the Bundesbank s council Schlesigner said But he added I don t see any great pressure to go away from it REUTER"

"WORLD BANK CAN AID PHILIPPINES LAND DEVELOPMENT","The World Bank s policies prevent it from lending money for the transfer of land from landowners to the landless but it can help finance development of the Philippines proposed land reform program a bank official said The World Bank by its established policies cannot use its resources to finance the transfer of assets from one group to another Our mandate is to finance investment related activities Rolando Arrivillaga the bank s resident representative in the Philippines told Reuters in an interview Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by a World Bank mission that came in March to review the land reform program and which said the bank would not be able to finance compensation payments for the transfer of land He said the Philippine government had never asked the bank to finance land transfers and the bank s position should not be taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program Clearly in the case of land reform the question of land transfer by definition is transferring assets from the landed to the landless Arrivillaga said However the bank as an institution can finance the development aspects of the program We will deal with the part of the program that deals with how to put the land to effective use once it has been transferred and how to make the on farm investments that are needed to attain the goal of improving the income level of the beneficiaries Arrivillaga said I wouldn t be surprised if other multilateral institutions are faced with similar constraints he said President Corazon Aquino s spokesman said last week that she was committed to launching the program which limits land holdings to seven hectares by using her sweeping powers of rule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reform program estimated to cost about billion pesos would be implemented in four phases and benefit mln farmers Benigno said the first two phases would complete the transfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as well as the transfer of land sequestered expropriated or foreclosed by the government and would cover mln hectares But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of large sugar banana and coconut plantations leaving it to the Congress to work out the details Benigno said Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors who form part of a consultative group led by the World Bank might be prepared to finance the land transfers I don t think there are fast and easy rules as to how international sources of finance would behave in a situation like this because land reform by its very nature requires rich financing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitable to both the landowner and the beneficiary he said Arrivillaga said the first priority for the government would be to tap domestic sources of financing for the land transfer but external assistance could be brought in if there were gaps In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness of the government is how it confronts the domestic resource requirement Arrivillaga said Multilateral agencies by their very nature are lenders of last resort It means they have to be convinced that the government prioritises the program He said the World Bank had financed developmental costs under an earlier land reform program launched by former President Ferdinand Marcos in and such aid had been channelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines LBP The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino s program If asked to do so again and the program is designed to improve the standard of living of the poor then we would certainly be prepared to consider lending Arrivillaga said He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate the costs by presenting ten year perspectives in a one year context Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its financing problems by devising effective instruments to compensate landowners Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said landowners are likely to be paid pct in cash and the rest in year bonds with pct of their face value redeemable each year Arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensate landowners had to be freely tradable at near face value and added The challenge is to devise a system of deferred payments that is as good as cash He said the international financing community was watching the Philippine experiment with great interest They are going to be an interesting model for many other countries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms to every sector of the population and even international institutions he said I think they ll be on a very solid base when they make the decision to launch the reforms REUTER"

"S AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET","South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation s flagging economic growth rate economic analysts said Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament the analysts said Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation said Rob Lee chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co South Africa this year is targeting inflation adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about pct while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over pct Economists estimate that the government s spending target will rise to about billion rand with revenue budgeted at around billion rand This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand or four pct of GDP The government having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget analysts said The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets South African Mutual s Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around billion rand this year leaving a deficit of between and pct of GDP compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned predicted one analyst noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September Against a background of Western economic sanctions falling per capita incomes rising joblessness and high inflation government officials say economic growth is the prime objective But private sector economists caution that the government s ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country s balance of payments Most of that surplus this year estimated at around billion dlrs will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation s estimated billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks Within these constraints economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini budget before the May whites only election The poll delayed presentation of the national budget This will not be a very exciting budget commented Harry Schwarz spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election REUTER"

"NEW PROBLEMS FOR WORLD BANK IN DEBT STRATEGY","The World Bank in the throes of a painful reorganization faces new strains because of actions by Citibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves financial analysts and monetary sources said The monetary sources said the reorganization has caused some bad feelings and charges that promotions and other personnel actions have been based on personality rather than ability It also had some effect in undermining the Bank s role in the global debt strategy the sources said At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber Conable whose reorganization efforts are getting some critical review from many Bank staff members and some member countries including the United States I think if he were to do it again he would do it very differently said one source Conable a former congressman from New York appointed by President Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly a year ago has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be reorganized and perhaps made more streamlined In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan administration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free market sources of assistance were available However the Bank had been singled out for a much greater role under the U S debt initiative proposed by Treasury Secretary James Baker That strategy which called for some billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine billion dlrs in spending from the development banks mostly the World Bank came under profound doubt with the decision by Citibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves This move heralded by some sources as a measure that gives all parties more time frightened others who see it as the beginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete unraveling of the monetary system As envisioned by the latter the next move would be for Brazil which has delayed payments on its debts to say it does not intend to pay interest for a very long period of time Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop financing the country s export credits the funds countries use to support their daily activities leading to an economic breakdown Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of business said one source Citibank s initial step last month was to set some three billion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans to developing countries It was followed by a similar move by Chase Manhattan some days later In the best of all worlds the kind of cooperation that was demonstrated between the International Monetary Fund IMF the multilateral development banks the wealthy countries and commercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in could emerge again but no one is expecting that If anything the negotiations have become much more confrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more concessions arguing that they face growing political instability if they are asked to do or pay more They are very critical of the IMF s austerity measures and there is sympathy for their view among the development community When you hear code words like structural adjustment and tightening your belt What that means is that the poor peasent making dlrs a year should drop it to dlrs says one source He adds And when your hear they should have market forces at play that means the level of public services should drop It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role in the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the debtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent poverty even further The Bank which primarily assists countries in the building of roads sewerage systems education and other so called infrastructure is viewed in the Third World as benefactor The IMF however which essentially forged the debt stategy following the disclosure by Mexico in that it was near default is considered a stern taskmaster that has little sympathy or even understanding of poverty But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative has worked and about the World Bank s success at bringing about increased growth in the Third World under the U S prescription which indicated that countries might grow their way out of their difficulty Reuter"

"BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY","The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said The council will meet in Saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around GMT But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a pct range for most of this month after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of pct allocating funds at pct They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or Lombard Winfried Hutmann chief economist of Schroeder Munchmeyer Hengst Investment GmbH said Werner Chrobok managing partner at Bethmann Bank said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity Chrobok said The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said A cut in the discount or Lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week s Venice summit But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can t risk increasing the deficit further said Schroeder Muenchmeyer Hengst s Hutmann Bethmann s Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy But I don t expect any convincing measures he said Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to pct from yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning June Two public holidays that week could also distort the market Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of pct and to fully replace the billion marks in an outgoing pact But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at pct rather than That would not represent a tightening of policy however Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at pct dealers said On another issue Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ECU at one of its meetings soon Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France and was twice under French occupation this century But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes REUTER"

"NEW LEADER COMING TO U S SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA","President Reagan s nominee as top policeman for the nation s securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets David Ruder a year old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill was named Thursday to be the rd chairman of the five member U S Securities and Exchange Commission If confirmed by the Senate as expected he will succeed John Shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street The investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky one of Wall Street s most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U S securities markets At the same time the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U S corporate landscape And the agency is being pushed by U S and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC s ability to enforce U S securities laws and guard investors from fraud Under the leadership of Shad the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency s review of hostile corporate takeovers Shad who had been vice chairman of the E F Hutton investment banking firm brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in In line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency s enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter a Democrat Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission s current priorities The SEC currently has about employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone By law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House Established by Congress in the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities It requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy later to become the nation s th president Other former chairmen include William Douglas who served from until his appointment to the U S Supreme Court in and William Casey who served during President Nixon s first term and was Reagan s director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year Reuter"

"BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE","The United States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates European economists said But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U S Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt according to official statements released late Monday Only hours after the statements were released the Bundesbank reduced short term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of pct down from a pct facility rate offered last week While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday It s round one to the Americans said Richard Reid senior European economist for brokers UBS Philips and Drew in London But Reid added We shouldn t forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a percentage point Over the weekend criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid Six leading industrial nations agreed under February s Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday the dollar was quoted at marks compared with on Monday Guenther Aschoff chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short term interest rates on Tuesday The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker s wishes then all the better he said No central bank wants to let interest rates rise and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the U S Aschoff said Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern Giles Keating economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battle But he hasn t won the war as the security repurchase rate is still points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington Before the IMF meeting when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at pct Keating noted Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington s efforts to reduce its trade deficit Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar s value Deutsche Genossenschaftbank s Aschoff stressed West Germany s heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability In addition both the U S And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar REUTER"
